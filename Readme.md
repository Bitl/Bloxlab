# Bloxlab

Bloxlab is a mod that adds items and props based on old Roblox.

Currently focusing on Crossroads weapons, but the plan is to add more than just that.

Note that this mod is a WORK IN PROGRESS. Some planned features may be added or removed, and this mod may be cancelled mid-development at any time. you are warned.

This mod has been tested on both Quest and PC to insure proper compatibility and functionality.

Note that this repository doesn't include the extended SDK scripts. Download the zip from [here][sdk], then extract the folder. Inside the folder, there should be another folder. Rename the folder to "Marrow-ExtendedSDK-main" and place it in the Assets folder. Unity SHOULD load it up fine.

More information on the [mod.io page][mod-io].
